  - heading: Animation Control from Script
    text: Create a new Monobehavior Script and attach it to your character. Add a public variable to the Animator so you can attach it in the editor -or- GetComponent the Animator in the Start method and store a class-level reference to it. In the Update method, add a control statement to check Input.GetKeyDown, and activate the Animator's previously attached trigger.
